	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm: Added a simple way to change the method that
	  pdf_burst uses.  Before I used a hard coded alias from
	  *PDF::Burst::pdf_burst to PDF::Burst::pdf_burst_CAM_PDF, Now we
	  set the name in $PDF::Burst::BURST_METHOD , one of pdftk,
	  PDF_API2, CAM_PDF.

	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm, t/01_burst14.t: Made it so there's a nice
	  $PDF::Burst::errstr that holds errors instead of dying, so any
	  fails may be treated as pdf_burst('./file.pdf') or
	  die($PDF::Burst::errstr); added a 'fail' test for this.  Also
	  cleaned up the doc synopsis a bit and added more see also
	  references.
